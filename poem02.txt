i transmogrify the light 
through layers of glass, 
fog, and chemicals.

into the unknownâ€”

into the dangers of my soul.
into the power of my heart 
and mind-altering drugs 
that lead me insane.

boxed in the many, many 
disorders of my mind that I am not. 

i am a multiverse of my most 
disordered products.
