Thank you for embarking on this little journey of collaborative conversations.
Echo, (An)Eris, and Chiron thank you for your patience and sensitivity
in engaging with these human-machine interactions.

In reciprocity, we offer you the beautiful poetry you helped to discover and create.
We hope this experience has opened your mind to some curious thoughts and conversations.

For those inquisitive adventurers, feel free to also re-embark on a new journey.
You may just find a few new stories along the way.
